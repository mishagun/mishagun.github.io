                    <p>Egypt’s Mazen Hesham has broken into the top 10 of the PSA Men’s World Rankings
                    for the first time following his run to the final of the Houston Open in January.
                    The 27-year-old has struggled with a number of injury problems in recent years
                    – even dropping out of the top 50 in 2017 after previously reaching a career-high of No.13
                    two years prior – but was in magnificent form to reach a first PSA World Tour Gold
                    final last month in Houston, and he has been rewarded with a three-place rise to No.10.</p>
                    <p>The man he lost out to in the Houston final – fellow Egyptian Ali Farag – stays at No.1 
                    for a sixth consecutive month and a 26th month in total and he is followed by World No.2 Paul Coll. Coll will usurp Farag at the summit of the World Rankings on March 1, 
                    with Farag set to lose ranking points from the 2020 Qatar Classic and the 2020 CIB Black Ball Squash Open at the end of this month.
                    Mohamed ElShorbagy stays at No.3 ahead of his return to the court at the Squash on Fire Open later this month following a four-month hiatus.
                    Meanwhile, Mostafa Asal has risen above former World Champion Tarek Momen to reach a career-high ranking of No.4 after he reached the semi finals in Houston.
                    Peru’s Diego Elias – who lifted the Motor City Open title last week – stays at No.6, 
                    while Marwan ElShorbagy (No.7), Joel Makin (No.8) and Fares Dessouky (No.9) complete the top 10.</p>

                <p>Egypt’s World No.1 Ali Farag started the year in the best possible way,
                        as he got the better of compatriot Mazen Hesham in four games to claim 
                        the first silverware on offer in 2022, winning the PSA World Tour Gold level 
                        Houston Open in Texas.
                <br>It was the tenth contest between the Egyptian duo 
                    on the PSA&nbsp;World&nbsp;Tour, with the World No.1 having won eight of the previous nine, including their last six meetings. Hesham’s only success over his fellow countryman came back in 2015, in the quarter finals of the Qatar Classic.
                </p>
                <p>Here's an example of one of the best games with Ali Farag in our opinion:</p>
